# Clan-Quest-Forum
Clan Quest Forum app

This app only works for android devices.
Install instructions:
  1. Click Download/Clone and download the .zip to your android device.
  2. Extract the files
  3. Open extracted folder named "Clan-Quest-Forum-master"
  4. Run app-debug.apk
  4.5 If this is your first time downloading an app from somewhere besides the playstore, it may ask you to change a security
      setting, if it does just tap the settings button and it will take you straight to the setting you need to change. If
      it doesn't it is under the security tab -> device administration -> unknown sources. Check that box and it will pop up.
  5. Click install
  6. Done!
  
The only reason that this app isn't just on the appstore is because I don't want to pay the $25 to have a developer account. Since it is not on the play store, it is hard for me to get feed back. If you have any issues using the app, please message me through the Clan Quest Forums, I am Guild Councilor Prinessi, or you can add an issue on the github page you downloaded the app from.
